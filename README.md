I plan to create a playwright-demo repository showing off different features of playwright.

For many of the tests I will be using - https://practicesoftwaretesting.com

The the first of many articles utilizing this repo can be found https://playwrightsolutions.com/how-do-you-define-an-apiurl-along-with-the-baseurl-in-playwright/

Getting Started
The framework we are using is Playwright. If you want a good video to introduce you to Playwright, check out this video. You can try out playwright in the cloud here.

npm install
npx playwright install
Running the automated checks
npx playwright test
Running the Code Generator

Running the Tests in VS Code
The Playwright team has released a VS Code Extension that allows you to debug tests easily with the click or right click of a button.

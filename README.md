# interactive-qa-task

This is the task was given by Interactive Investment to me as a QA Engineer. 

**Getting Started**

I will be building a Playwright framework with Typescript. 

My framework is based on Page Object Model. So, while locators and methods are stored in Page files, test cases can be found under the test field as spec files.

The given task and answers will be found under the TASK.md file. Further responses will be discussed in in person interview.


**Installation**

If you want to run this on your local machine, git clone the repo to local. In the main directory run the below commands. This will install playwright dependencies on your machine.

npm install

npx playwright install

**Running the automated checks**

npx playwright test

**Running the Code Generator**

npx playwright codegen

**Running the Tests in VS Code**

The Playwright team has released a VS Code Extension that allows you to debug tests easily with the click or right click of a button.
